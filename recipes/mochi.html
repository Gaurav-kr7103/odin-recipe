    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mochi are small, sweet Japanese cakes made with glutinous rice flour (mochiko). They have a soft, chewy outer layer and a deliciously sticky filling made of sweetened red bean paste. Freezing the red bean paste before you use it is optional but it does make the process easier.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sweetened red bean paste</li>
        <li>1 cup glutinous rice flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon green tea powder (matcha)</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup cornstarch, for rolling out the dough</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Batter:</strong>
            <p>In a microwave-safe bowl, mix the glutinous rice flour, water, and sugar until smooth.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Batter:</strong>
            <p>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Microwave on high for 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Stir the mixture, then microwave for an additional 15 to 30 seconds until it becomes thick and translucent.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Mochi:</strong>
            <p>Dust a clean surface with cornstarch. While the mochi is still warm, transfer it to the prepared surface. Divide the mochi into small portions and shape them into balls or discs. Dust each piece with more cornstarch to prevent sticking.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong>
            <p>Allow the mochi to cool completely. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two days.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
