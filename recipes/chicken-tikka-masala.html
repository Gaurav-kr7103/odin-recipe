        <p>Chicken Tikka Masala is a rich and flavorful Indian-inspired dish featuring tender, marinated chicken pieces cooked in a creamy, spiced tomato-based sauce. <br>
            The chicken is first marinated in yogurt and a blend of aromatic spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala, then grilled or pan-seared to achieve a smoky, charred flavor. <br>
            It is then simmered in a luscious, velvety sauce made with tomatoes, cream, butter, and fragrant seasonings, creating a perfect balance of heat and richness. This dish is best enjoyed with naan, roti, or steamed basmati rice, making it a favorite comfort food for spice lovers around the world.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
        <li>¼ cup plain yogurt </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <strong>Steps:</strong>
        <li>Make the chicken: Combine yogurt, garam masala, paprika, black pepper, salt, cayenne pepper, and coriander in a large bowl. Add chicken strips and toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade and place onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each piece.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and cook, sirring gently, until lightly toasted and aromatic, about 3 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until onion begins to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Add chile peppers, garlic, and ginger; continue to cook and stir until onion is browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, and water; cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes begin to break down, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add garam masala, coriander, turmeric, and salt, then stir in chicken and cream until well combined; cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.</li>
