    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chinese Fried Noodles, also known as "Chow Mein" in many places, are stir-fried noodles that are typically served as a main dish or as a side with other Chinese specialties. The dish often includes thin, egg noodles that are stir-fried to achieve a slightly crispy texture, while remaining tender on the inside. The noodles are cooked with a variety of colorful vegetables like bell peppers, onions, carrots, and cabbage. <br>

        In addition to vegetables, proteins such as chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu are commonly added. The dish is seasoned with a rich sauce made from soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and sometimes hoisin sauce, giving it a savory, umami-rich flavor. <br>
        
        Chinese Fried Noodles can be customized to suit individual preferences, with variations depending on regional differences or dietary restrictions. Some versions feature a simple stir-fry, while others may incorporate a more complex mix of sauces, making it a versatile and comforting dish enjoyed by many.</p>
